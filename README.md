# Overmind Quest: NFT Marketplace

Used Sui's 'Move' to develop a smart contract to mimic a marketplace where the users can sell anything and not just NFT(Sui declares every object as NFT). Sellers can create a shop, add items to it, unlist those items and buyers can purchase those items. The seller has the funcationality of withdrawing SUI accumulated by selling.
